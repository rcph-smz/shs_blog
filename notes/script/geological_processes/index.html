                sometimes causing great destruction, as a result of movements

                <!-- What is an earthquake, earthquake is a sudden movement of ground along the faults lines  -->
                <!--  Earthquakes occur along faults, which are fractures between blocks of rock that allow the blocks to move relative to one another. -->
                Earthquake is a sudden movement of ground along the faults lines when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another
                (Plate boundaries are always faults, but not all faults are plate boundaries)

            <div class="note-content">
                Most reasons earthquake happens is when:
                <!-- - Volcanic Eruption Occur when enough magma builds up in the magma chamber in which it forces its way up to the surface and erupts -->
                - Volcanic Eruption Occur, which creates Volcanic Earthquake
                - Plate tectonic boundaries slips, that could lead into Tectonic Earthquake
                <!-- convection inside earth -->
                - and Induced Earthquakes which is cause by human activity like tunnel construction and filling reservoirs

            <div class="note-content">
                Earthquake could also cause some hazards like:
                - Ground rupture/surface fault
                - Ground Shaking
                - Liquefication
                - Tsunami, etc
                Just to name a few

                <!-- When solid is converted into a liquid state by absorbing heat energy, it is known as liquefaction. The melting of ice is an example of liquefaction. -->
                The hazards of ground shaking are mostly damaging or collapsing tall buildings ,it can also cause some landslides, mudslides, avalanches, melting or also known as Liquefication.
